# We scare because we care

## Introduction
In this part we're going to tackle one of the trickier instructions, Load Word or **LW**.

We're going to discuss one of the peculiarities of the early MIPS (and other RISC designs), 
the **load delay-slot**. 

First we'll outline how an interpreter might go about handling such subtleties by introducing
additional state.

Then we'll describe making similar changes to our recompiler, by creating additional state to help 
us to keep track of load delay-slots during recompilation.

We'll discuss using the stack to store variables in order to deal with the load delay-slot and 
introduce the **LEA** x86â€“64 instruction.

Finally, we'll discuss the pitfalls of our simple approach.

## Recap
Last time we implemented the StoreWord or **SW** instruction.

```c++
void EmitSw(EmitterX64& emitter, R3051& processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Store word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call store word
    CallStoreWord(emitter, processor, opcode);
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume)
}
```

We introduced the concept of interpreter functions signalling success or failure by returning
a boolean value and having the recompiler testing the return value in order to decide if 
we should return from the recompiled code.

## Forever delayed
To begin our discussion we present the format of **LW** instruction, which like **SW**, is an *I-Type* instruction.

![Load Word I-Type Layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/part-07-0/load_word_i_type_layout.png)

The challenge with implementing the **LW** instruction is that it introduces one of the most problematic
elements of emulating the MIPS R3000 family, the **load delay-slot**.

As a consequence of the early MIPS pipeline design the effects of a load instruction are not 
immediately observable. There is a one instruction delay and attempting to read the affected 
register will return the old value. In effect, loads on the R3000 take two instructions to 
complete. The second instruction is said to occupy the load delay-slot.

As an example, in,

```asm
LW R2, (R3) ; R2 is 6, (R3) is 10
NOP ; Load delay-slot! R2 is still 6
ADDU R5, R2, R4 ; R2 is now 10
```

the loaded value isn't visible to the programmer until the **ADDU** instruction.

The design intention was that clever compilers could utilise load delay-slots efficiently but,
anecdotally at least, most inserted No-Operations (**NOPs**) into load delay-slots and chose 
to waste cycles instead.

Things aren't as straightforward as they might seem because there are a number of complications 
we have to keep in mind while handling load delay-slots.

1. Exceptions can occur in load delay-slots, and the delayed load has to be completed before
the exception can be processed. 
2. Load instructions can occur in load delay-slots. In most cases the delayed load completes,
but when two load instructions in succession target the same destination register, the original
load never completes.
3. Certain instructions, **LWL** and **LWR** for example, can access the loaded value early.

It is worth noting that later revisions, starting with the R4000, changed things so that loads 
were immediately visible to the programmer and removed this particular cognitive burden.

## What a load
Let's provide a function to allow the processor to retrieve values from the
outside world similar **StoreWord** discussed in the [previous part][part-06-0].

```c++
bool LoadWord(R3051* r3051, uint32_t virtualAddress, uint32_t* value) {
    return true;
}
```

The function returns **true** if the operation completes without exception and places the result in
the **value** argument, which is passed by pointer.

Extending the interpreter to support load delay-slots will require,

```c++
class R3051 {
private:
    //...
    bool loadDelaySlot;
    bool loadDelaySlotNext;
    uint32_t loadDelayRegister;
    uint32_t loadDelayValue;
};
```

The **loadDelaySlot** variable tells the interpreter that the *current* instruction is in 
a load delay-slot. The **loadDelaySlotNext** variable tells the interpreter that the *next*
instruction is going to be in a load delay-slot.

The interpreter will also need to remember which register was the target of **LW** instruction
and the value that was retrieved from memory. These are stored in **loadDelayRegister** and
**loadDelayValue** respectively.

## A matter of interpretation
We can now modify the interpreter to manage load delay-slots.

```c++
void Interpret(R3051* r3051) {
    uint32_t instruction = ReadNextInstruction(r3051);
    ExecuteInstruction(r3051, instruction);
    if (GetLoadDelaySlot(r3051)) {
        const uint32_t r = GetLoadDelayRegister(r3051);
        const uint32_t v = GetLoadDelayValue(r3051);
        WriteRegister(r3051, r, v);
    }
    bool next = GetLoadDelaySlotNext(r3051);
    SetLoadDelaySlot(r3051, next);
    SetLoadDelaySlotNext(r3051, false);
}
```

Now, after executing an instruction, it checks to see if we completed a delay-slot instruction
and if so completes the load operation. It then moves the current value of **loadDelaySlotNext**
into **loadDelaySlot** and assumes the instruction after next isn't going to be in a load delay
slot.

An interpreted implementation of **InterpretLW** then might look something like

```c++
void InterpretLw(R3051* r3051, uint32_t opcode) {
    const uint32_t rt = InstructionRt(opcode);
    if (GetLoadDelaySlot(r3051)) {
        const uint32_t dr = GetLoadDelayRegister(r3051);
        const uint32_t dv = GetLoadDelayValue(r3051);
        if (rt != dr) {
            WriteRegister(r3051, dr, dv);
        }
        SetLoadDelaySlot(r3051, false);
    }
    const uint32_t base = ReadRegisterRs(r3051, opcode);
    const uint32_t offset = InstructionImmediateExtended(opcode);
    uint32_t value;
    if (LoadWord(r3051, base + offset, &value)) {
        SetLoadDelaySlotNext(r3051, true);
        SetLoadDelayRegister(r3051, rt);
        SetLoadDelayValue(r3051, value);
    }
}
```

There are two points of interest here. 

Firstly, after decoding the target register, the method checks to see if we're currently 
in a delay-slot. If we are, then it retrieves the delayed target register and value, and 
if the current load instruction isn't targeting the same register, it completes the delayed
load (remember, when two consecutive load instructions target the same register, 
the first load never completes). As the delayed load is now complete, the method then clears 
the load delay-slot flag, thus preventing the interpreter loop from mistakenly completing the load
we're about to set up an instruction early.

Secondly, if the load completes without raising an exception as we would hope, rather than writing to the
register immediately, the method stores the register number and loaded value into the interpreter state
and tells the interpreter that the *next* instruction is going be in a load delay-slot.

## No memory, no problems
With the necessary interpreter changes described we can now turn our attention to the recompiler.
Our goal is to provide the **EmitLw** function and it looks something like this,

```c++
void EmitLw(EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Load word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    if (delay slot) {
        ??? Complete delayed load ???
    }
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call load word
    ??? CallLoadWord(emitter, processor, opcode); ???
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    ??? Synchronise up any load delay-slot specific state ???
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume);
    ??? set next instruction as delayed ???
    ??? remember target register ???
    ??? remember loaded value ???
}
```

It's similar to the **EmitSW** function implemented in the previous part because
a memory access can cause an exception there's the necessary code to exit the recompiled
routine early. 

However, there' a bit more to work to be done. At the top of the function
the recompiler needs to know if the current instruction is in a load delay-slot, and if so
it needs to emit the necessary code to complete the delayed load. This is similar to the 
logic at the top of the **InterpretLw** function.

If an exception occurs as a result of calling **LoadWord** then whatever the recompiler
knows about such things as load-delay slots needs to be written back to the interpreter,
so that if required, the interpreter can continue normal execution.

Finally, after emitting all the necessary instructions, the recompiler needs to inform 
itself that the next instruction is going to be in a load delay-slot and which register
was involved in the delayed load, much like the interpreter in **InterpretLW**.

This then strongly implies that our recompiler needs to be *stateful*.

## The Memory Remains
In order to help the recompiler manage load delay-slots we introduce **RecompilerState** 

```c++
class RecompilerState {
private:
    uint32_t loadDelayRegister;
    bool loadDelaySlot;
    bool loadDelaySlotNext;
};
```

to help track if the instruction currently being recompiled is in a delay-slot, its target register,
and if the next instruction is going to be a delay-slot instruction. 

The load delayed value is not part of the **RecompilerState** since generally we do not know the 
value to be loaded at recompile time. The recompiled code may itself modify the value in memory
during execution and the value we used during recompilation will then be wrong.

_Note_: There is of course an exception to this, and that is when the value is being loaded from ROM 
(Read Only Memory) but by making the assumption that the loaded value is not known at recompile time,
we can use the same code for both cases.

The recompiler loop will also need changing to look something like

```c++
RecompilerState state;

for (const uint32_t opcode : opcodes) {
    Emit(state, emitter, processor, opcode);
    if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
        ??? complete delayed load ???
    }
    bool loadDelaySlotNext = state.GetLoadDelaySlotNext();
    state.SetLoadDelaySlot(loadDelaySlotNext);
    state.SetLoadDelaySlotNext(false);
}
```

This hopefully looks similar to the modified interpreter loop. 

After emitting an instruction we check to see if we emitted an instruction that was in a
delay-slot. If so, then the recompiler needs to emit code to complete the delayed load.

We also then update the recompiler's delay-slot flags in a similar fashion that
of the interpreter loop.

The code for **EmitLW** will now look something like 

```c++
void EmitLw(RecompilerState &state, EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Load word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    const uint32_t rt = InstructionRt(opcode);
    if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
        const uint32_t dr = state.GetLoadDelayRegister();
        if (rt != dr) {
            ??? complete delayed load ???
        }
        state.SetLoadDelaySlot(false);
    }
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call load word
    ??? CallLoadWord(emitter, processor, opcode); ???
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    ??? Synchronise up any load delay-slot specific state ???
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume);
    // Update recompiler state
    state.SetLoadDelaySlotNext(true);
    state.SetLoadDelayRegister(rt);
}

```

with a check to see if the recompiler is emitting a load delay-slot instruction prior to 
calling **LoadWord** and the recompiler state being updated to indicate the next recompiled instruction
is going to be in a load delay-slot.

In the next section we'll discuss how to implement **CallLoadWord** by using the stack.

## The House That Stack Built
Before any of this can be made to work, the recompiled code is going to have to retrieve
the value to be loaded and store it somewhere for the duration of one instruction.

That somewhere is going to have to be in memory because if you recall signature of 
the **LoadWord** function 

```c++
bool LoadWord(R3051* r3051, uint32_t virtualAddress, uint32_t* value);
```

the value read is returned by pointer.

This means that the recompiled code needs a 32-bit location in memory it can pass to this 
function as a pointer. There a number of places we could use, including but not limited to, 
the address of a **R3051** member variable, an address in dedicated space allocated to the 
recompiled code or, our choice for this part, the stack.

_Note_: The choice to use the stack here is somewhat arbitrary. It was motivated by wanting 
to learn a bit more about the x64 ISA and since we have the base pointer **RBP** available it
might be possible to generate shorter code.

Since the stack was discussed a long time ago in [Part 2.5][part-02-5]
let's briefly recap what the function prologues and epilogues do.

The prologue pushes the caller's **RBP** onto the stack and then moves the current **RSP**
into **RBP**. Thereby establishing our method's stack frame. At this point **RSP** and **RBP**
have the same value.

The epilogue then reverses this operation by restoring the original value of **RBP** by popping
it back off the stack.

As discussed in [Part 2.5][part-02-5], if we want to store variables in the stack, then we 
have to reserve space by subtracting from **RSP**. The situation can be seen in the diagram below.

![Stack diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/part-07-0/stack-diagram.svg)

On the left-hand side we have the state of **RSP** and **RBP** after initially setting up the stack
frame and on the right-hand side we have the state of **RSP** and **RBP** after subtracting 
16 from **RSP**.

By subtracting 16 from **RSP** (remember the stack has to be 16-byte aligned) we're reserving space 
for four 32-bit variables. We're going to use the upper four bytes to store our load delayed values. 
The address of these four bytes is **RBP - 4** and this is the address we want to pass to **LoadWord**.

In order to do this, our prologues and epilogues need to be as follows,

```c++
CodeBuffer buffer(1024);

// Prologue
EmitterX64 emitter(buffer);
emitter.PushR64(RBP);
emitter.MovR64R64(RBP, RSP);
emitter.SubR64Imm8(RSP, 16);

// Epilogue
emitter.AddR64Imm8(RSP, 16);
emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
emitter.PopR64(RBP);
emitter.Ret();
```

subtracting and adding 16 to reserve and free space respectively.

The implementation of **CallLoadWord** (recalling **CallStoreWord** from the [previous part][part-06-0]) is as
follows,

```c++
void CallLoadWord(
        EmitterX64 &emitter,
        R3051 &processor,
        uint32_t opcode) {
    const uint32_t rs = InstructionRs(opcode);
    const uint32_t offset = InstructionImmediateExtended(opcode);
    const size_t size = sizeof(uint32_t);
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RDI, AddressOf(processor));
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RSI, processor.RegisterAddress(0));
    emitter.MovR32Disp8(RSI, RSI, static_cast<uint8_t>(rs * size));
    emitter.AddR32Imm32(RSI, offset);
    ??? MOVE RBP minus 4 into RDX ???
    emitter.Call(AddressOf(LoadWord));
}
```

with the outstanding task of putting **RBP - 4** into **RDX** to pass as the 3rd parameter.

How do we do this?

Well we could do it by moving **RBP** into **RDX** and subtracting **4** from **RDX**, but there's another way.

There's an instruction called **LEA** which stands for **L**oad **E**ffective **A**ddress.
What this instruction does is compute the effective address of a location in memory and
instead of loading the value in memory at that address into the register, it simply loads the address,
which is precisely what we want.

Consulting [^1] gives us an implementation of **LeaR64Disp8** that looks like

```c++
void EmitterX64::LeaR64Disp8(uint32_t reg, uint32_t rm, uint8_t disp8) {
    const uint8_t rex = Rex(1u, reg >> 3u, 0, rm >> 3u);
    const uint8_t mod = ModRM(1u, reg, rm);
    buffer.Bytes({rex, 0x8D, mod, disp8});
}
```

and **CallLoadWord** looks like

```c++
void CallLoadWord(
        EmitterX64 &emitter,
        R3051 &processor,
        uint32_t opcode) {
    const uint32_t rs = InstructionRs(opcode);
    const uint32_t offset = InstructionImmediateExtended(opcode);
    const size_t size = sizeof(uint32_t);
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RDI, AddressOf(processor));
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RSI, processor.RegisterAddress(0));
    emitter.MovR32Disp8(RSI, RSI, static_cast<uint8_t>(rs * size));
    emitter.AddR32Imm32(RSI, offset);
    emitter.LeaR64Disp8(RDX, RBP, static_cast<uint8_t>(-4));
    emitter.Call(AddressOf(LoadWord));
}
```

placing **RBP - 4** into **RDX**.

Our implementation of **EmitLw**, with the addition of the call to **LoadWord**, now looks like

```c++
void EmitLw(RecompilerState &state, EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Load word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    const uint32_t rt = InstructionRt(opcode);
    if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
        const uint32_t dr = state.GetLoadDelayRegister();
        if (rt != dr) {
            ??? complete delayed load ???
        }
        state.SetLoadDelaySlot(false);
    }
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call load word
    CallLoadWord(emitter, processor, opcode);
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    ??? Synchronise up any load delay-slot specific state ???
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume);
    // Update recompiler state
    state.SetLoadDelaySlotNext(true);
    state.SetLoadDelayRegister(rt);
}
```

In the next section we'll discuss how to complete delayed loads since this is required by
both **EmitLW** and the recompiler loop.

## The Persistence of Memory
In order to complete a delayed load we're going to have to move the load delayed value
from the stack back into the **R3051** register array. These locations are both in memory
but as [^2] states, memory to memory moves aren't possible with x64, so we're going to have to 
go via a Host register.

Therefore, given a Guest register **rt** we want to write to we can achieve this in three steps

1. Loading the load delayed value from the stack into **RAX**
2. Loading the address of the register array into **RCX**
3. We can then move **RAX** to an address pointed to by **RCX** and the 8-bit displacement of **rt**

We have all the methods in the emitter available to us, so we can propose a method of the form

```c++
void WriteGuestRegisterFromStack(EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor, uint32_t rt) {
    const size_t size = sizeof(uint32_t);
    emitter.MovR32Disp8(RAX, RBP, static_cast<uint8_t>(-4));
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RCX, processor.RegisterAddress(0));
    emitter.MovDisp8R32(RCX, static_cast<uint8_t>(rt * size), RAX);
}
```

and with this the **EmitLW** method is nearly complete, with just the state synchronisation missing,

```c++
void EmitLw(RecompilerState &state, EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Load word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    const uint32_t rt = InstructionRt(opcode);
    if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
        const uint32_t dr = state.GetLoadDelayRegister();
        if (rt != dr) {
            WriteGuestRegisterFromStack(emitter, processor, dr);
        }
        state.SetLoadDelaySlot(false);
    }
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call load word
    CallLoadWord(emitter, processor, opcode);
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    ??? Synchronise up any load delay-slot specific state ???
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume);
    // Update recompiler state
    state.SetLoadDelaySlotNext(true);
    state.SetLoadDelayRegister(rt);
}
```

and we now complete the recompiler loop.

```c++
for (const uint32_t opcode : opcodes) {
    Emit(state, emitter, processor, opcode);
    if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
        const uint32_t dr = state.GetLoadDelayRegister();
        WriteGuestRegisterFromStack(emitter, processor, dr);
    }
    bool loadDelaySlotNext = state.GetLoadDelaySlotNext();
    state.SetLoadDelaySlot(loadDelaySlotNext);
    state.SetLoadDelaySlotNext(false);
}
```

All that remains is to discuss exception handling.

## Synchronicity I
Up until now we've been diligently avoiding what to do in the event of an exception.

The reason is that it's _complicated_.

In order to make our recompiled code smaller we haven't been synchronising the load delay 
related state back to the **R3051** after every instruction. The less the recompiled code
does the faster it is.

However, whenever we exit from our recompiled code, we have to restore the related state.
Not only do we have to do this during a normal exit, we have to do it for every single
exception.

In our exploratory recompiler this means we have to write back four fields during an exit.

Three of the fields, the delay-slot target register, the delay-slot and the next
delay-slot state can be written back using the **CallInterpreterFunction** developed in
[Part 3][part-03-0]. There are potentially more efficient mechanisms, but those
are left as an exercise for the reader.

In order to call the **SetLoadDelayValue**

```
SetLoadDelayValue(R3051*, uint32_t);
```

function, we're going so need to be able to call an interpreter function with the second argument
retrieved from the stack.

This can be achieved with,

```
void CallSetLoadDelayValue(EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor) {
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RDI, AddressOf(processor));
    emitter.MovR32Disp8(RSI, RBP, static_cast<uint8_t>(-4));
    emitter.Call(AddressOf(SetLoadDelayValue));
}
```

which moves the contents of **RBP - 4** into **RSI** to pass it as the second argument
to the underlying interpreter function.

The recompiled epilogue can then take the form

```c++
// Epilogue
CallSetLoadDelayValue(emitter, processor);
CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelayRegister), processor, state.GetLoadDelayRegister());
CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelaySlotNext), processor, state.GetLoadDelaySlotNext());
CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelaySlot), processor, state.GetLoadDelaySlot());

emitter.AddR64Imm8(RSP, 16);
emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
emitter.PopR64(RBP);
emitter.Ret();
```

which takes the values from the recompiler state and writes them back to the guest processor as 
one would hopefully expect.

The **EmitLw** function is a little different,

```c++
void EmitLw(RecompilerState &state, EmitterX64 &emitter, R3051 &processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Load word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    const uint32_t rt = InstructionRt(opcode);
    if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
        const uint32_t dr = state.GetLoadDelayRegister();
        if (rt != dr) {
            WriteGuestRegisterFromStack(emitter, processor, dr);
        }
        state.SetLoadDelaySlot(false);
    }
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call load word
    CallLoadWord(emitter, processor, opcode);
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    CallSetLoadDelayValue(emitter, processor);
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelayRegister), processor, 0u);
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelaySlotNext), processor, false);
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelaySlot), processor, false);
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume);
    // Update recompiler state
    state.SetLoadDelaySlotNext(true);
    state.SetLoadDelayRegister(rt);
}

because in the event of an exception we tell the interpreter that we're no longer in a delay-slot
since prior to calling **LoadWord** we completed the delayed load. Technically calling **SetLoadDelayValue**
here is redundant since the recompiler's value is now stale, so this could be removed.

## Synchronicity II
The exception handling in **EmitLW** differs from the normal flow exception handling flow
since when a **LW** instruction is issued in a load delay-slot it has to complete the delayed load
before performing any interactions that may raise an exception.

For other instructions like **ADDU** that raise an exception the exception handling code
should complete the pending load. In effect, something like

```c++
// Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
emitter.Jne(resume);
if (state.GetLoadDelaySlot()) {
    const uint32_t dr = state.GetLoadDelayRegister();
    WriteGuestRegisterFromStack(emitter, processor, dr);
}
CallSetLoadDelayValue(emitter, processor);
CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelayRegister), processor, 0u);
CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelaySlotNext), processor, false);
CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(SetLoadDelaySlot), processor, false);
emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
emitter.PopR64(RBP);
emitter.Ret();
emitter.Bind(resume);
```

should suffice. 

This then means in the event of an exception, the recompiled leaves the interpreter in 
a state where it's able to resume execution at the exception handler without a delayed load
pending.

## Now you have two problems
It's worth pointing out some details here that are worth keeping in mind.

1. This first exploratory approach into handling delay slots rather closely mimics what the interpreter
was doing, and I think it's worth discussing alternative approaches before proceeding to branch instructions.
2. There is an unstated assumption here that the processor is not in a load delay-slot when being passed
to the recompiler. As it stands this might not always be the case and this requires further thought.
3. The current code assumes that the recompiler can exit after any kind of instruction and that normally
isn't the case. Normally recompilers exit after a branch, so we're almost (but not completely, thanks 
**branch delay-slots**!) guaranteed not to exit the recompilation routine in a load-delay slot.

## Conclusion
If you've survived all that then I offer my congratulations.

In this part we implemented the Load Word (**LW**) instruction and discussed one of the peculiarities 
of the early MIPS architecture, the **load delay-slot**.

We outlined how an interpreter could handle load delay slots and interactions with exceptions.

We adapted our recompiler to handle load delay-slots and used the host stack to store the value
to be loaded across instructions.

We added the **LEA** instruction to the emitter so that our recompiler can easily interact with 
interpreter functions taking pointer arguments.

Finally, we covered the topic of synchronising recompiler and interpreter state only when needed
to avoid performing extraneous work.

In the next apart, we'll briefly explore other approaches to handling load delay-slots.
