# The Adventure Continuesâ€¦

## Introduction
In this part we're going to start exploring how the MIPS family of Microprocessors
communicate with the outside world.

Up until now we've been recompiling operations that work entirely on registers, 
and now we turn our attention to the class of instructions that allow the processor
to interact with the system's memory.

We're going to start with the **Store Word** instruction which will allow us to 
store words in memory. This will allow us to explore how to handle functions 
that return values.

The MIPS family has other store instructions for other operand sizes (Half-word and byte) 
but the principles should hold for these variants.

## Recap

Last time we recompiled the **ADD** instruction while introducing the concept of
exception handling in the MIPS family of processors.

```c++
R3051 processor;
processor.WriteRegister(1, 0x40000000);
processor.WriteRegister(2, 0x40000000);
const uint32_t opcode = 0x00221820u; // ADD R3, R1, R2

CodeBuffer buffer(1024);

EmitterX64 emitter(buffer);
emitter.PushR64(RBP);
emitter.MovR64R64(RBP, RSP);

EmitAdd(emitter, processor, opcode)
  
emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
emitter.PopR64(RBP);
emitter.Ret();

buffer.Protect();
buffer.Call();
```

We introduced the concepts of **Jumps** and **Labels** to our **Emitter** and
provided a means by which we can skip over short segments of recompiled code.

## I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
Let's introduce a function called StoreWord to be able to store a word to memory.

```c++
bool StoreWord(R3051* r3051, uint32_t virtualAddress, uint32_value) {
    return true;
}
```

There a number of features to note about this function.

1. The second argument is a *Virtual Address*. When a program or process is 
executing in a multitasking environment things are arranged in such a way so that 
the program thinks it's the only program running and that it has access to a contiguous 
block of memory. The reality might be entirely different and behind the scenes the 
processor may be accessing non-contiguous blocks of memory. The task of mapping from a 
*Virtual Address* to a *Physical Address* (i.e. a real one) is normally handled by Coprocessor 0.
2. As the chipset evolved members of the MIPS family handled this task in different ways. 
The more expensive models within a revision used something called a Translation Look-aside 
Buffer (**TLB** for short) to do the translation and the cheaper ones used a static, 
or fixed mapping. Since implementing a **TLB** is a task in and of itself we elide the 
translation process here and assume the existence of the necessary functions at a later date.
3. The method returns a bool. This is to signal to the caller if the store operation 
was successful or not. The function could fail for any number of reasons, 
from an exception raised by the Address Translation itself, to the processor attempting
to write to a region of memory when it doesn't have sufficient privileges to do so. 
It is also assumed that, for now, this method does the exception handling on 
behalf of the caller.

The **SW** instruction is an I-Type instruction with its fields laid out as follows

![Store Word I-Type Layout]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/part-06-0/store_word_i_type_layout.png)

An implementation for the interpreter might look as follows

```c++
void InterpretSw(R3051* r3051, uint32_t opcode) {
    const uint32_t base = ReadRegisterRs(r3051, opcode);
    const uint32_t t = ReadRegisterRt(r3051, opcode);
    const uint32_t offset = InstructionImmediateExtended(opcode);
    StoreWord(r3051, base + offset, t);
}
```

using the **InstructionImmediateExtended** function we wrote for **ADDIU** to extend the offset.

The return value from **StoreWord** is ignored since in the case of failure the Program Counter 
is now pointing to one of the Exception Vectors and the next pass of the interpreter loop 
will resume execution from that point.

## This deal's getting worse all the time
The task for the recompiled version is to exit from the recompiled function when a problem 
arises with **StoreWord** much like the **ADD** instruction in the previous part.

Let's introduce a new helper function **CallStoreWord**, which will emit a call to the underlying 
**StoreWord function**.

```c++
void CallStoreWord(
        EmitterX64& emitter,
        R3051& processor,
        uint32_t opcode) {
    const uint32_t base = InstructionRs(opcode);
    const uint32_t rt = InstructionRt(opcode);
    const uint32_t offset = InstructionImmediateExtended(opcode);
    const size_t size = sizeof(uint32_t);
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RDI, AddressOf(processor));
    emitter.MovR64Imm64(RDX, processor.RegisterAddress(0));
    emitter.MovR32Disp8(RSI, RDX, static_cast<uint8_t>(base * size));
    emitter.AddR32Imm32(RSI, offset);
    emitter.MovR32Disp8(RDX, RDX, static_cast<uint8_t>(rt * size));
    emitter.Call(AddressOf(StoreWord));
}
```

Unlike all the previous interpreter functions we've called **StoreWord** takes not 2, 
but 3 arguments. Consulting the System V AMD64 ABI[^1] we learn that the third argument is 
to be passed in the **RDX** register.

The address of the **processor** is to be stored in **RDI**; the virtual address computed in 
**RSI** and the value we want to store in **RDX**.

There's a small amount register reuse here. We initially use **RDX** to store the address of 
MIPS register **R0** but immediately prior to the call we update it with the contents of MIPS 
register **Rt**.

The outline for the recompiled version of is then as follows

```c++
void EmitSw(EmitterX64& emitter, R3051& processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Store word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call store word
    CallStoreWord(emitter, processor, opcode);
    //if (StoreWordFailed()) {
        emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
        emitter.PopR64(RBP);
        emitter.Ret();
    //}
}
```

In case any exception occurs during **StoreWord**, it first updates the interpreter's copy 
of the Program Counter by calling **WritePC**. This is pre-emptive since in our current design 
any exception handling during **StoreWord** is going to be done by the interpreter functions. 
This includes the aforementioned misaligned address and data bus errors.

After we call **StoreWord**, we need to determine if an exception occurred, so we can return from the 
recompiled function. How do we do this?

The System V AMD64 ABI says that functions put their return values in **RAX**. Functions returning a boolean 
value like **StoreWord** place **1** in **RAX** to represent **true** and **0** to represent **false**.

The task is to determine if **RAX** contains **0** or **1**. Two instructions can help us here

1. **Test AL, Imm8** logically ANDs the contents of the immediate 8-bit value and the lower 8-bits
of the **RAX** register and sets the Zero flag when the result is zero and clears it otherwise.
2. **Jne/Jnz**, or Jump Not Equal/Non-Zero, jumps to the target when the Zero flag is clear.

If we test **RAX** with **1** and the Zero flag is clear (i.e. the result was non-zero) then we
want to continue with the execution, otherwise we want to stop.

After consulting the Intel Reference Manual[^2] let's build upon our previous work by adding two more 
functions to our **Emitter**.

```c++
void EmitterX64::TestALImm8(uint8_t imm8) {
    buffer.Bytes({ 0xA8, imm8 });
}

void EmitterX64::Jne(const Label& label) {
    buffer.Bytes({ 0x75u, 0x00u });
    const size_t position = buffer.Position();
    if (label.Bound()) {
        FixUpCallSite(static_cast<CallSite>(position), label);
    } else {
        callSites[label.Id()].emplace_back(position);
    }
}
```

Note that the **Jne** and **Jno** functions in our **Emitter** since they are virtually identical,
but I am choosing to live with a small amount of repetition for didactic purposes.

Finally, we can put this all together to get

```c++
void EmitSw(EmitterX64& emitter, R3051& processor, uint32_t opcode) {
    // Store word
    Label resume = emitter.NewLabel();
    // Restore the program counter
    CallInterpreterFunction(emitter, AddressOf(WritePC), processor, 0xBADC0FFE);
    // Call store word
    CallStoreWord(emitter, processor, opcode);
    // Return from recompiled function in event of an exception
    emitter.TestALImm8(1u);
    emitter.Jne(resume);
    emitter.MovR64R64(RSP, RBP);
    emitter.PopR64(RBP);
    emitter.Ret();
    emitter.Bind(resume);
}
```

to conclude our discussion of the **SW** instruction.

## Conclusion
In this article we discussed how one might go about implementing the store family of MIPS instructions. 
As a consequence, our processor implementation can now write to external Memory and Memory Mapped Devices.

Along the way we learned how to pass a 3rd argument to an interpreter function and how to process function
return values as specified by the System V AMD64 ABI.

In the next part, we'll finally try to load values from memory by implementing the LW or Load Word instruction. In order to do this we'll have to introduce the concepts of delay-slots and Pipeline Hazards.
